# Password Generator

## Introduction
This was a solo project implemented for UCB Full Stack Bootcamp 2021. The project was to implement a random password generator that takes in a password length and ask user for character types to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters). A new password is then generated matching the user's criteria.
